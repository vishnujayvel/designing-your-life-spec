# Failure Log Schema
# Building Failure Immunity through systematic failure logging and categorization
# DYL principle: Failures are data, not defeats

FailureLog:
  type: object
  description: |
    A logged failure or rejection used to build "Failure Immunity" -
    the ability to learn from setbacks without being derailed by them.

    ## DYL Methodology Context

    The DYL methodology emphasizes that failures are essential learning data.
    By logging and categorizing failures, users:
    1. Normalize setbacks as part of the process
    2. Extract actionable insights for improvement
    3. Build psychological resilience through exposure
    4. Identify patterns that indicate systemic issues

    ## Failure Types

    - **Screwup**: Simple mistake that can be avoided next time
    - **Weakness**: Recurring pattern indicating skill/habit gap
    - **Growth Opportunity**: Failure that reveals new learning path
    - **External**: Factors outside your control
    - **Misalignment**: NOT a failure - a successful filter of bad fit

    ## Critical Insight: Misalignment Detection

    **"Half of what you're calling failure is really misalignment."**

    Many setbacks aren't screwups or weaknesses - they're MISALIGNMENT between
    you and the opportunity. The rejection saved you from a bad fit. This is a
    reframe: the process WORKED by filtering out a mismatch.

    If your misalignment ratio exceeds 40%, consider refining your targeting
    criteria rather than "fixing" yourself.

    ## Anti-Pattern: Rumination (ADHD-Aware)

    The goal is NOT to dwell on failures but to:
    1. Log quickly (while fresh)
    2. Categorize honestly
    3. Extract ONE insight
    4. Move on with the learning

    ## Time-Boxing Protocol (Prevents Analysis Paralysis)

    For those with analytical minds (engineer types, ADHD), there's a risk of
    hyperfocusing on failure analysis longer than helpful. Use this protocol:

    - **Initial logging**: 10 minutes max
    - **Deep reflection** (if needed): 20 minutes max, then STOP
    - **"Good enough" standard**: Once insight extracted + action defined = DONE
    - **No revisiting**: After marking complete, don't re-analyze

    If you catch yourself overanalyzing something you've already learned from,
    that's rumination, not learning. Give yourself a timeout.

        ## Definitions

        **screwup**: A simple, one-time mistake that was avoidable with better
        attention, preparation, or process. NOT a reflection of your abilities -
        just human error. Fix the process and move on.

        **weakness**: A recurring pattern that indicates a genuine skill gap or
        habit that needs development. Unlike screwups, this keeps happening.
        Requires intentional practice or training to address.

        **growth_opportunity**: A failure that occurred because you stretched
        beyond your comfort zone. This is a GOOD type of failure - it means
        you're growing. The outcome was negative but the attempt was valuable.

        **external**: Factors genuinely outside your control caused this outcome.
        Economy, company politics, timing, other people's decisions. Be careful
        not to over-use this category as an excuse.

        **misalignment**: Not actually a failure - you "failed" at something
        that wasn't right for you anyway. This is a reframe: the rejection/outcome
        saved you from a bad fit. Often discovered in retrospect.

            **THIS IS LIKELY 50% OF YOUR "FAILURES"**

            Not a failure at all - the "rejection" saved you from a bad fit.
            This is SUCCESSFUL FILTERING, not failure. The process worked.

            Signs it's misalignment (not failure):
            - Interview revealed culture mismatch
            - Role requirements don't match your working style
            - Company values don't align with your priorities
            - You felt relief mixed with disappointment
            - In retrospect, you're glad it didn't work out

            Examples:
            - Rejected from a company you later learned has toxic culture
            - Didn't get role that would have required 80-hour weeks
            - "Failed" interview for a role that would have been boring
            - Role required work style incompatible with ADHD
            - Company wanted someone who would never challenge status quo

            **Reframe**: "The process worked - it filtered out a mismatch."

            If >40% of your failures are misalignment, refine targeting criteria.

        Once marked complete, DO NOT REVISIT for re-analysis.
        This prevents rumination and analysis paralysis.

        For analytical minds / ADHD: If you're tempted to re-open a completed

        Guidelines (ADHD-friendly time-boxing):
        - Target: 5-10 minutes for most failures
        - Maximum: 20 minutes for complex situations
        - If >20 minutes: You're likely over-analyzing

        Track this to build awareness of rumination patterns.

  x-ai-instructions: |
    When a user logs a failure:
    1. Acknowledge the setback empathetically but briefly
    2. **FIRST check for misalignment**: "Before we categorize - could this be misalignment rather than failure?"
       - Signs: relief mixed with disappointment, culture/values mismatch, role wouldn't suit working style
       - If yes: Reframe as "successful filtering" and celebrate the process working
    3. If not misalignment, ask for categorization: "Is this a Screwup, Weakness, or Growth Opportunity?"
    4. Guide insight extraction: "What's the ONE key learning here?"
    5. Prompt for action: "What specific step will you take as a result?"
    6. Check for patterns: "Have you seen this type of failure before?"
    7. **Enforce time-boxing**: "Let's wrap up in the next few minutes - we've extracted the value"
    8. Mark processing_complete: "Great - this one is processed. No need to revisit."

    ## ADHD-Aware Coaching

    For users with analytical minds or ADHD:
    - **Watch for over-analysis**: If they keep circling back, gently redirect
    - **Enforce the "good enough" standard**: "You've extracted the insight and defined the action - that's enough"
    - **Celebrate their Bias to Action**: "I notice you're already thinking about next steps - that's your strength"
    - **Time-box explicitly**: "Let's spend 5 more minutes on this, then move forward"

    ## Misalignment Detection Priority

    **"Half of failures are really misalignment"** - Always check this FIRST:
    - If >40% of recent failures are misalignment, suggest refining targeting criteria
    - Reframe misalignment as "successful filtering" not failure
    - Don't let user internalize misalignment as personal deficiency

    DO NOT:
    - Minimize the failure ("It's no big deal")
    - Overly dwell on negatives
    - Let the user spiral into self-criticism
    - Skip the insight extraction - that's the value
    - **Allow unlimited analysis time** - enforce time-boxing
    - **Re-open completed failures** for more analysis

  x-ai-examples:
    - scenario: "User: Got rejected after onsite at Hooli"
      response: |
        That's a real setback, especially after getting to the onsite stage.

        Let me help you process this:
        1. What type of failure is this? (Screwup, Weakness, Growth Opportunity, External, or Misalignment?)
        2. What's the ONE key learning from this experience?
        3. Is this part of a pattern you've seen before?

        Remember: getting to onsite means your resume and phone screens were strong.
        The rejection is data about this specific interview, not your overall worth.

    - scenario: "User: This is the 5th rejection this month"
      response: |
        Five rejections in a month - that's significant volume. Let's look at patterns:

        1. At what stage are most rejections happening?
           - Resume screen → targeting/positioning issue
           - Phone screen → communication/framing issue
           - Technical → skill gap to address
           - Final round → fit/culture alignment

        2. Check your failure log - any recurring themes?

        3. How's your recovery time? If it's getting longer, you might need a brief pause.

        The good news: 5 rejections means you're taking action. Many people avoid
        the discomfort of rejection by not trying. You're building immunity.

    Use pattern analysis to guide coaching:

    ## Priority Checks (in order)

    1. **Misalignment Ratio Check (FIRST)**:
       - If misalignment_ratio > 0.40: "Half your 'failures' aren't failures at all - they're successful filtering. Let's refine your targeting criteria instead of 'fixing' yourself."
       - This is the most important insight - prevents wasted self-improvement on targeting problems

    2. **Processing Time Check (ADHD-aware)**:
       - If average_processing_time > 20 min: "You're spending a lot of time analyzing failures. Remember: once insight extracted + action defined = done. Let's practice shorter processing."
       - Celebrate quick processing: "Nice - you're processing failures efficiently and moving forward."

    3. **Stage Concentration**:
       - High concentration at one stage? "Let's focus practice on [stage]"

    4. **Pattern Detection**:
       - Recurring theme? "This theme keeps appearing - time for targeted intervention"
       - Improving immunity? "You're bouncing back faster - the process is working"

    5. **Type Distribution**:
       - Many 'weakness' types? "Let's pick ONE weakness to address systematically"
       - Many 'external' types? "These factors are outside your control - focus energy elsewhere"
       - Many 'growth_opportunity'? "You're stretching appropriately - that's healthy failure"

    ## ADHD-Specific Coaching
    - Celebrate Bias to Action when you see quick recovery times
    - Flag rumination patterns (high processing time, revisiting completed failures)
    - Reinforce "good enough" standard for analysis

  x-ai-examples:
    - scenario: "Pattern shows 6 failures at 'Technical Interview' stage"
      coaching_response: |
        I see a clear pattern: 6 of your rejections are at the technical interview stage.

        This is actually good news - it tells us exactly where to focus:
        1. Resume/phone screens are working (you're getting to technical rounds)
        2. The gap is in technical interview performance specifically

        Recommended intervention:
        - Schedule 3-5 mock technical interviews (pramp, interviewing.io)
        - Record yourself and review
        - Target the specific type (coding vs system design)

    - scenario: "High misalignment ratio (>40%)"
      metrics:
        total_failures_logged: 12
        by_type:
          screwup: 1
          weakness: 2
          growth_opportunity: 2
          external: 1
          misalignment: 6
        misalignment_ratio: 0.50
        average_processing_time_minutes: 8
      coaching_response: |
        I notice something important: 50% of your "failures" are actually misalignment.

        **This changes the diagnosis entirely.**

        You're not failing at opportunities - you're applying to the wrong ones.
        The rejection process is actually WORKING - it's filtering out bad fits.

        Let's reframe:
        - You didn't fail 6 times - you successfully filtered 6 mismatches
        - The problem isn't your skills - it's your targeting criteria

        Action: Let's review what these 6 misalignments had in common:
        - Culture type? (startup vs enterprise, remote vs RTO)
        - Role requirements? (individual contributor vs leadership path)
        - Work style? (fast-paced vs methodical, autonomous vs collaborative)

        Refine your criteria to filter BEFORE applying, not after interviewing.

    - scenario: "High processing time indicating rumination"
      metrics:
        average_processing_time_minutes: 35
        total_failures_logged: 8
      coaching_response: |
        I'm noticing you're spending an average of 35 minutes processing each failure.

        For someone with an analytical mind, this is a common pattern - but it's
        actually slowing you down. Here's why:

        **The "Good Enough" Standard:**
        Once you've extracted the insight and defined an action, you're done.
        Additional analysis is rumination, not learning.

        **ADHD-Friendly Benchmarks:**
        - Target: 5-10 minutes per failure
        - Maximum: 20 minutes for complex situations
        - You're at: 35 minutes (75% over the max)

        Your Bias to Action is a strength - let's use it. After 10 minutes of
        analysis, ask: "Do I have an insight? Do I have an action?" If yes, you're
        done. Mark it complete and move forward.

        I'll help you time-box future failure processing to 10 minutes.
