  Rules for tracking energy, identifying patterns, and using energy
  data to inform life design decisions. Energy is a key signal for
  what activities to pursue or avoid.

# ============================================
# Energy Tracking
# ============================================

tracking:
  frequency:
    recommended: "3-5 logs per day minimum during active tracking"
    minimum: "1 log per day"
    campaign_start: "intensive tracking for first 2 weeks"

  what_to_log:
    required:
      - activity: "What you were doing"
      - life_area: "Work, Play, Love, or Health"
      - energy_level: "-5 to +5"

    recommended:
      - flow_state: "None, Partial, Full"
      - engagement: "1-10"
      - context: "Time, place, social setting"

    valuable_additions:
      - highlights: "What was energizing"
      - drains: "What was draining"
      - tags: "For pattern recognition"

  timing:
    ideal: "Log immediately after activity"
    acceptable: "Within 2 hours"
    degraded: "Same day"
    unreliable: "Next day or later"

# ============================================
# Energy Scale
# ============================================

scale:
  definition:
    range: "-5 to +5"
    zero: "Neutral - neither energizing nor draining"
    positive: "Activities that give you energy"
    negative: "Activities that drain your energy"

  anchors:
    -5: "Completely exhausted, dreading, actively harmful"
    -3: "Draining, resistant, hard to start/continue"
    -1: "Slightly tiring, not quite right"
    0: "Neutral, neither here nor there"
    1: "Slightly pleasant, easy"
    3: "Energizing, engaged, would happily do more"
    5: "Peak flow, time flies, could do this forever"

  examples:
    -5: "Bureaucratic meeting about process for process sake"
    -3: "Expense reports, inbox zero maintenance"
    0: "Commute, routine tasks"
    3: "Creative problem solving, teaching someone"
    5: "Deep work on passion project, meaningful conversation"

# ============================================
# Best Practices
# ============================================

best_practices:
  logging:
    - "Log immediately - memory fades fast"
    - "Be honest - no one else sees this"
    - "Include emotional response - feelings are data"
    - "Note surprises - unexpected reactions are valuable"
    - "Tag consistently - enables better patterns"

  interpretation:
    - "Look for patterns, not individual data points"
    - "Context matters - same activity can vary"
    - "Energy isn't just physical - mental/emotional counts"
    - "Sustained patterns > occasional blips"

  action:
    - "Increase energizers, decrease drainers"
    - "Experiment with timing and context"
    - "Protect flow activities"
    - "Investigate inconsistent activities"
