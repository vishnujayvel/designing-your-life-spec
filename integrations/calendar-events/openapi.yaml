    Lightweight, token-efficient calendar event schema for LLM consumption.

    ## Purpose
    Abstracts provider-specific formats (Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar)
    into a minimal common schema optimized for:
    - Token efficiency (~80-150 tokens/event vs ~200-400 raw)
    - LLM context windows
    - Cross-provider portability
    - Semantic search (includes description for RAG pipelines)

    ## Provider Support
    Currently mapped from:
    - Google Calendar API (via google-calendar MCP)

    Future providers need only implement the mapping layer.

    ## Relationship to DYL Coach
    This schema is consumed by DYL Coach for:
    - Prototype scheduling (linking experiments to calendar)
    - Life balance analysis (work vs play distribution)
    - Interview/prep tracking
    - Constraint checking (max interviews/week)
