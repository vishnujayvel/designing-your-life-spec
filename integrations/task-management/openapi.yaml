    Lightweight, token-efficient task management schema for LLM consumption.

    ## Purpose
    Abstracts provider-specific formats (Asana, Todoist, Things, TickTick)
    into a minimal common schema optimized for:
    - Token efficiency (~40-60 tokens/task vs ~150-300 raw)
    - LLM context windows
    - Cross-provider portability

    ## Provider Support
    Currently mapped from:
    - Asana API (via asana MCP)

    Future providers need only implement the mapping layer.

    ## Relationship to DYL Coach
    This schema is consumed by DYL Coach for:
    - Task context in standups
    - Prototype task tracking
    - Life balance analysis (by life_area)
    - Anti-pattern detection (overdue counts)

    ## Entity Hierarchy

    ```
    TaskList (collection)
    ├── Task (actionable item, may link to Prototype)
    ├── Routine (recurring pattern, links to Tasks)
    └── Activity (one-time, non-experimental action)
    ```
