        accepted. Focus on controllable factors within the constraint.

/schemas/life-challenge/gravity:
  get:
    operationId: getGravityChallengeSchema
    summary: GravityChallenge Schema
    description: |
      A constraint that cannot be changed (like gravity). The goal is acceptance
      and working within the constraint, not solving it.

      Example: "I'm 50 years old and can't start over" → Accept the constraint,
      focus on what IS possible at your current life stage.
